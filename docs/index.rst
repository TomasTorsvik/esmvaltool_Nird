Welcome to esmvaltool_Nird's documentation!
===========================================

The esmvaltool_Nird repository has been created to store scripts that will 
support use of ESMValTool within a NIRD Toolkit framework, and recipes for
specific types of analysis. It is assumed that the user already has access to
a jupyter or jupyterhub application running on the NIRD Toolkit system, and
access to storage space from a project.
